## Main Function

```go
func main()
```


The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the program was executed with exactly one command-line argument.
   - If the argument count is not 2, it displays a usage message and returns.
2. Creates a log file with the name `<file.torrent>logFile.txt`.
   - If the creation of the log file fails, the program terminates with a fatal error.
3. Sets the log output to the created file, so log messages are written to the file.
4. Sets the log prefix to `LOG: `.
   - The log prefix is added to each log message.
5. Sets the log flags to include the date and time.
6. Opens the specified torrent file using the `muonengine.Open` function from the `bitmuon/muonengine` package.
   - If an error occurs during the opening process, the program terminates with a fatal error.
7. Displays the name of the torrent file and its size in megabytes.
8. Initiates the download process for the torrent file using the `DownloadTorrent` method of the `torr` object.
   - If an error occurs during the download process, the program terminates with a fatal error.
